# üîí Raspberry Pi ‚Äî Secure Shutdown Procedure

This file documents how to safely shut down *Taylor‚Äôs Pi* while protecting the VeraCrypt container and Docker services.

---

## üß© Overview
System references:
- User: `taylo`
- VeraCrypt container: `/mnt/external/My files.hc`
- Mount point: `/mnt/secure`
- Docker Compose directory: `/home/taylo/docker`
- Key services using VeraCrypt: `filebrowser`, `resilio`
- Script location (new): `/usr/local/bin/shutdown_secure.sh`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Script ‚Äî `/usr/local/bin/shutdown_secure.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# --- Paths from your system profile ---
VERACRYPT=/usr/bin/veracrypt
DOCKER=/usr/bin/docker
COMPOSE_DIR="/home/taylo/docker"
MOUNTPOINT="/mnt/secure"

echo "[+] Stopping Docker services that use VeraCrypt ..."
cd "$COMPOSE_DIR"
$DOCKER compose stop filebrowser resilio || true

echo "[+] Dismounting VeraCrypt container ..."
if mountpoint -q "$MOUNTPOINT"; then
    $VERACRYPT --dismount "$MOUNTPOINT" || {
        echo "[-] Normal dismount failed, forcing..."
        $VERACRYPT --force --dismount "$MOUNTPOINT"
    }
else
    echo "[=] VeraCrypt volume already dismounted."
fi

echo "[+] Waiting for filesystem flush ..."
sleep 5

echo "[+] Shutting down the system safely ..."
/usr/sbin/shutdown -h now

üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/shutdown_secure.sh
# Paste script contents

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shutdown_secure.sh

## üîÑ Auto-Restore Behavior
After safe shutdown and power-up:
- The systemd service `restore-secure.service` triggers `/usr/local/bin/restore_secure.sh`.
- This script checks `/mnt/external`, mounts the VeraCrypt container to `/mnt/secure`, and starts the required Docker services.
- No manual steps are required post-boot (password prompt appears only if volume is unmounted).
